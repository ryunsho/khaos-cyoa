        <h3>Day 1</h3>
        <p>You find yourself sitting in an office, shadowed by the light of an endless amount of souls. Each one of them
            hovers and floats around you, their stories reduced and condensed into a single sheet of paper, all stacked
            neatly on the side of your desk. On the papers are only a brief description, their virtues, their sins, and
            the
            decision: heaven or hell.</p>

                        fun
                        of him and often wished misfortune upon them.</p><br>

        <p>Heaven. Hell. Hell. Heaven. The choices continue.</p>
        <p>It keeps going on and on. An endless cycle. The names start to blur into one another and everything
            starts to
            look monotonous. Black and white. But you have to continue.</p>
        <p>It's your job. Your duty. Your purpose.</p>
        <p>Your name is Azariel Dalvir, a reaper who decides the fates of souls with an impartial judgement. The
            gods
            have placed their faith in you, and you need to carry out their will.</p>
        <p>But as the hours stretch longer, a thought crosses your mind. A question that had always been in the
            corner
            of your mind, one that you could never dare to voice.</p>
        <p><i>Is this all there is?</i></p>

        <div class="choice1"><a class="day1choice1" onclick="day1choice1function()" id="day1choice1btn">Choice 1:
                Bare
                with the boredom and continue working.</a></div>
        <div class="choice2"><a class="day1choice2" onclick="day1choice2function()" id="day1choice2btn">Choice 2:
                Take a
                break and reflect for a moment.</a></div>
    </div>

    <div id="day1choice1text" class="fade-text">
        <p><b>Bare with the boredom and continue working.</b></p>
        <p>You scratch that thought out of your head. It’s not the time to be doubting yourself.</p>
        <p>There’s still work to do. Souls to judge.</p>
        <p>You can’t stop now.</p>
        <p>...</p>
        <p>The day ends as it always does. You continue making decisions until your shift is over. Until the last
            soul is sorted.</p>
        <p>You stare at the paperwork on your desk. Profiles of the virtuous and the sinful neatly stacked in two
            piles in front of you.</p>
        <p>Tonight, as you lay in bed, you think about the people you judged. Their lives, their goals, their
            stories—they must have been so fulfilling. Nothing like your own.</p>
        <p>You suppress the thoughts for now. Tomorrow’s a new day, and you’ll need to continue your duty.</p>
        <p>However, as you slowly drift to sleep, you dream of colours you’ve never seen before, sounds you’ve never
            heard, visions of people, and lives you could never live. As you continue to fall asleep, you wonder if
            you’ll ever be able to
            experience that someday…</p>
    </div>
    <div id="day1choice2text" class="fade-text">
        <p><b>You decide to take a break from working for a bit.</b></p>
        <p>You stare at the soul profiles on ur desk. The descriptions of these people. They’re so short, lacking
            detail
            about their lives. You know that there are more to these stories. There must be.</p>
        <p>Your mind starts drifting off. You think about the mortal realm, where these souls all come from. You can
            only imagine what it’s like—chaotic, unpredictable, alive. As an entity of the afterlife, a servant of
            the
            gods, you’ve never been allowed to leave this realm. But as these souls flow in, you keep wondering…
            what is
            it like?</p>
        <p>What is it like to do whatever you wished?</p>
        <p>What is it like to be unbound to these duties that keep you chained down at this desk?</p>
        <p>What is it like to be…free?</p>
        <p>It’s a dangerous thought to be having. Reapers aren’t allowed to stray from their station, and yet, as
            you
            continue dazing into space, you keep wondering.</p>
        <p>What if you could?</p>

<!--
notes:
maybe background can change depending on the choices
change colour theme to retro game style?
add images but make them dithered/pixellated to match aesthetic
consider making all the text pixel-based as well?

what if i make the choices input-based instead of buttons.. >:)
