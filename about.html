        <h1>About This Project</h1>
        <p>
            <i>Khaos: A Choose Your Own Adventure</i> is an interactive narrative set in a realm beyond life and death.
            You take the role of Azariel Dalvir, a "reaper" tasked with judging souls. Heaven or hell...those are the
            choices you're given.
        </p>
        <p>
            But what happens when duty turns into doubt? When repetition starts to blur your sense of purpose? As you
            progress through the story, the lines between what’s right, what’s real, and what’s yours begin to fade.
        </p>
        <p>
            Your decisions will shape not just the fates of others, but also the story of Azariel themselves.
            There are no wrong choices... only consequences.
        </p>
